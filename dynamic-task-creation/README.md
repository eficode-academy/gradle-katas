# Dynamic task creation

## Generating multiple tasks

Create a task for each `.src` file in the `sources` directory that prints the contents of the file.

- Run `gradle tasks`
- Assert you have generated a task for all 7 files
- Run one of your generated tasks
- Assert the task prints the file's contents
