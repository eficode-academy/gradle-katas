## Create a build task

### Output folder and files
- In the build task, define an output folder called output and create a file called author.h
- Q: Did you successfully create a file in the output folder?

### Writing to file
- Now, write to the file where you define the author of the file.
- Q: Does it read #define AUTHOR $whoami ?
- __Hint: use the System.getProperty('user.name')__
