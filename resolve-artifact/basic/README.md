## Resolve artifact

### In the build.gradle, define your dependency based on the last exercise
- Q: When typing the command 'gradle dependencies', can you see your artifact referenced

### Unpack the zipped dependency into a lib folder
- Q: main.c is looking for the author.h in a specific folder, did you get it right?

### Create a task that compiles the main.c file.
- Q: Why did it not work?

### Make the compile task dependent on the unpack task
- Q: When typing the command './a.out', was the output as expected?
