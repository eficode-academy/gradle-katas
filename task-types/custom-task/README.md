# Task types

## Using custom task types

This exercise's `build.gradle` contains a custom task type, `Cowsay`.

Create a task using the `Cowsay` type.

- Run your task
- Assert the output is adequately humorous

Configure the inherited `message` property on your task, setting it to a value of your choice.

- Run your task again
- Assert the task now prints your custom message
