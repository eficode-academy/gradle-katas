#Task types

## Creating custom types

Are you familiar with the cowsay command line application?

`cowsay Good morning!`

gives you something like this:

```
_________________ 
< Good morning! >
----------------- 
       \   ^__^
        \  (oo)\_______
           (__)\       )\/\
               ||----w |
               ||     ||
               
```

- Add a task that inherits the method and property of the task type 'Cowsay'
- Q: Execute the task, what was printed out?

- Now add a personal greeting to the newly made task
- Q: Did the cow provide you with the right greeting?
