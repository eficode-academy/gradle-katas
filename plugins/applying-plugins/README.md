# Gradle plugins

Why recreate something someone has done better than you?

## Finding useful plugins

We're looking for a plugin that can help us with building a C project.
Look through Gradle plugin repositories for a plugin that can solve our problem:
    - [docs.gradle.org](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/standard_plugins.html)
    - [plugins.gradle.org](https://plugins.gradle.org/)
    - [ksoichiro/awesome-gradle](https://github.com/ksoichiro/awesome-gradle)

- Locate the C plugin

## Applying plugins

- Run `gradle tasks`
- Apply the plugin to your `build.gradle` build script
- Run `gradle tasks`
- Assert new tasks appear in your task list
- Q: How did you apply your plugin? Are there other ways of doing so?

## Configuring plugins

Configure the C plugin to build our executable using the [documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/native_software.html#sec:building_an_executable).

The structure is as follows:
```
src
└── main
    └── c
        ├── author.h
        └── main.c

```

 - Run `gradle build`
 - Assert the executable was built and placed in `build/exe/main`
 - Run the `main` application
 - Assert you are greeted by the application
