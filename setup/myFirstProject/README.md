## Gradle setup

Setting up a Gradle project is fairly easy. A single command will provide you with the files and folder necessary

- Run the command `gradle initÂ`
- Observe the files generated

Explore the build environment

- Run the command `gradle projects`
- Observe the name of your root project

Create a subproject
- Run the command `mkdir miniProject`
- At the top of settings.gradle, append "include 'miniProject'"
