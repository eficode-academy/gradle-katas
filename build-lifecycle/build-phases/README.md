# Build phases

The `build.gradle` script in this exercise contains a property and two tasks:
- `setTheValue` changes the value of `theValue`
- `printTheValue` prints the value of `theValue`

Predict the outcome of the following commands:
- `gradle printTheValue`
- `gradle setTheValue printTheValue`

Run the commands and note the printed values.
 - Q: Did the output match your expectations? If not, what tripped you up?
