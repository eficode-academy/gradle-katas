# Groovy (basic)

## Hello, world!

Modify the `script.groovy` file to print `Hello, world!` on execution.

- Run `groovy script.groovy`
- Q: Was the output as expected?

## Defining variables

First, store three numbers in three different variables.

Then add, subtract, multiply or divide the numbers however you like, store the result in a new variable.

Finally, print the result.

- Run `groovy script.groovy`
- Q: Was the output as expected?
- Q: What types did you use for your variables? Are there any other options?

## Interacting with lists

Define an empty list variable.

Then add the title of three films, shows or songs you like to the list.

Iterate over the list and print out the names of its items.

- Run `groovy script.groovy`
- Q: Was the output as expected?
- Q: Did you add your items individually, all at once, or during initialization?
- Q: How did you iterate over the list? Are there any alternative ways?

## Logic paths

Store a number in a variable.

Then, write some code that prints the number if it's lower than 10, and prints `"Whoa, that's too big!"` if it isn't.

- Run `groovy script.groovy`
- Q: Was the output as expected?
- Q: What are some other ways to write such a conditional block? What are their up- and downsides?
